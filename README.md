## Work Experience
### Data Scientist II | Farmers Insurance - 2022-11-15 - Present
Spearheaded a million-dollar marketing initiative, leveraging Python and a broad data science toolkit to analyze performance and identify
inefficiencies. Discovered 10% bind/bounce rate increase, optimized testing methodology, and saved upwards of $10,000 in flawed tests.
Extracted key trends from various platform analytics and implemented data-driven recommendations, achieving a 40% increase in
primary conversion rate.
Managed cross-functional projects from start to finish: built and documented Github workflows, oversaw incrementality testing,
established ad data pipelines, and trained teams on Snowflake and Python algorithms. These initiatives increased marketing
measurement accuracy by 15%.
Mentored 10+ colleagues through bi-monthly data science workshops and Github code reviews. Led the development of a collaborative
matchback algorithm using Dice Coefficients via Python in Snowflake and fostered cross-functional training on Python libraries
(CausalPY, Prophet, Causal Inference) as well as Sagemaker workshops.

### Data Scientist | Progressive Corporation - 2020-10-15 - 2022-11-15
Developed and implemented a predictive SARIMAX model to forecast consumer behavior, resulting in campaign optimizations and
securing an additional $5 million in spending.
Designed and oversaw the implementation of ETL pipelines and dashboard suite using AWS and Snowflake, enabling cross-department
collaboration and reporting on findings using advanced SQL queries and Tableau visualizations. Achieved a 20% improvement in KPIs.
Acted as the primary data scientist, setting up and analyzing A/B tests, querying from petabyte-scale databases, cleaning data, and
conducting data mining on consumer behavior to recommend optimal budget allocation.

### Graduate Research Assistant | Columbia University - 2019-06-15 - 2020-06-15
Applied K-means clustering and designed a linear regression model using scikit-learn to identify user clusters in a large dataset, leading
to a research paper proposal.
Created, maintained, and improved dynamic reports, graphs, and charts through dashboarding tools and programming languages,
including Python and SQL.
